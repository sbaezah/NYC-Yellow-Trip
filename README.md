NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Analysis

This repository aims to demonstrate the construction and analysis of data on yellow cab trips in NYC.
The SQL code is available in the "\scripts" folder, which includes everything from creating the layers for the medallion architecture to creating the tables in the bronze, silver, and gold layers.
The gold layer has the most code, as more dimensional tables and the fact table had to be built.
